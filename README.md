## WBS Coding School Final Project

In a world where everything is accelerating and you are seemingly expected to be faster, better and richer, it is easy to feel overwhelmed and alone. A general awareness of mental health and mindfulness has only emerged in the last few years, not least thanks to the internet. But many people still find it difficult to open up themselves to others.

Today I Feel wants to support you in developing more mindfulness towards yourself and other people. By anonymously sharing how you're feeling every day, you'll get suggested articles based on your mood that may be helpful to you. You can also see the mood of the community on a graph - weekly and overall. You're not alone. For example, learn how to deal better with stressful situations. Or what you can do to have a more restful sleep.

If an article contains incorrect information, you can report the article using a form. Without providing your email address.

We are not trained psychologists and/or therapists. Our offer does not replace professional help and should not be. That is why you will also find links and telephone numbers on our site where you can get professional help in a crisis or stressful situation.
